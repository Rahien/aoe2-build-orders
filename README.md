# AoE2 Profile: Builds

This app allows you to create, manage and follow AoE2 build orders on your phone.
It has currently only been tested on chrome for android and is not meant to be used in a desktop environment.

To see it in action, visit https://builds.aoe2-profile.com

Many thanks to Cicero for publishing his build orders online, some of these build orders are included by default in this app. I hope to add more build orders as time progresses...

Many thanks to Microsoft to allow creators like me to use their assets. Age of Empires II: HD© and Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition© Microsoft Corporation. AoE2-profile was created under Microsoft's ["Game Content Usage Rules"](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/developers/rules) using assets from Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition, and it is not endorsed by or affiliated with Microsoft.
